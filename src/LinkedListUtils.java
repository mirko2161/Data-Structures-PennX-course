/**
 * Note: Homework tests require that the class being tested is in the default package.
 *
 * SD2x Homework #1 Implement the methods below according to the specification in the assignment
 * description. Please be sure not to change the signature of any of the methods!
 *
 * Implement the following methods in the LinkedListUtils.java file:
 *
 * insertSorted: This method assumes the input LinkedList is already sorted in non-descending order
 * (i.e.,such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that is before it, and inserts
 * the input int value into the correct location of the list. Note that the method does not return
 * anything, but rather modifies the input LinkedList as a side effect. If the input LinkedList is
 * null, this method should simply terminate.
 *
 * removeMaximumValues: This method removes all instances of the N largest values in the LinkedList.
 * Because the values are Strings, you will need to use the String classâ€™ compareTo method to find
 * the largest elements; see the Java API for help with that method. If the input LinkedList is null
 * or if N is non-positive, this method should simply return without any modifications to the input
 * LinkedList. Keep in mind that if any of the N largest values appear more than once in the
 * LinkedList, this method should return remove all instances, so it may remove more than N elements
 * overall. The other elements in the LinkedList should not be modified and their order must not be
 * changed.
 *
 * containsSubsequence: This method determines whether any part of the first LinkedList contains all
 * elements of the second in the same order with no other elements in the sequence, i.e. it should
 * return true if the second LinkedList is a subsequence of the first, and false if it is not. The
 * method should return false if either input is null or empty.
