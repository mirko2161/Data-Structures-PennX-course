# Data Structures and Software Design by Penn University

A repository for code from the course, my solutions to the homework assignments etc.

## Description

This course teaches you how to write “good” software that appropriately represents and organizes
 data, is easy to maintain, and is of high quality. You will learn about important core data 
structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, trees, and graphs, and learn how 
 to evaluate them and reason about their behavior and efficiency.

Most importantly, you will learn how to determine which data structure is the most appropriate 
for solving the problem at hand, and see how to use the implementations that are part of the
 Java library.

You will learn about software design principles such as modularity, functional independence, and 
abstraction, and apply those concepts toward writing programs that are easy to understand, easy
 to modify, and easy to test.

## Course Outline:

• Week 1 - Core data structures: Working with Linked Lists, Hash Sets, and Maps in Java.

• Week 2 - Advanced data structures: Working with Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and Graphs in Java.

• Week 3 - Software design: Documenting the design of software, understanding the need for good
 design, using design principles to achieve high-quality software.
 
• Week 4 - Implementing and improving software: Making existing code easier to understand, more
 reliable, and more efficient.
